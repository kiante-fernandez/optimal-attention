"Directed Cognition (roughly) as defined by Gabaix and Laibson (2005).

The DC policy does a limited kind of look-ahead by considering different
amounts of additional sampling that it could commit to. It estimates the VOC
for taking one additional sample to be max_N VOC(take N samples). This is a
lower bound on the true VOC.
